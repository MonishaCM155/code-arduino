# 🤖 Obstacle Avoiding Robot

An autonomous Arduino-based robot that detects and avoids obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servo motor. The robot moves forward by default, stops when an obstacle is detected, scans left and right to find a clearer path, and turns accordingly. Motor speed is controlled using PWM for smooth movement. This project is designed for learning basic robotics, sensors, and motor control.
